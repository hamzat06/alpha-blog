# README
This app is built with Rails version 6.0.3.1 and Ruby version 2.6.7

I learned how to implement crud operation in both the routes and controllers.

Learned how to create models and controller from scratch without generator and other rails magic.

And the best is the automated testing. It was really fun learning that too lol.

It was really fun building this. The UI isn't too great coz i didn't write any custom CSS for it but i built this blog just to be sound in the backend world!

i can say freely now that i have now become a Junior Backend Developer.

Which also makes me a FullStack developer coz of my Vue JS skill.

If you are reading this... Ruby on rails is the most easy to understand framework. Start from the basics by learning Ruby, then rails becomes easier to learn.

I didn't understand some stuffs at some point till we started reusing them which made it clearer.

I will be building more projects soon. Next is gonna be A CHAT APP.

Thank you for reading. Hamzat Ajanaku.
